## 🛠️ Optimization Summary

### 🧹 General Cleanup

- Removed unused/duplicate scripts and inline styles
- Removed bloated font requests and legacy tags

### ⚙️ Performance Enhancements

- **Deferred JavaScript:** Non-critical scripts are now placed at the end of the body with `defer`
- **Preloaded Stylesheets:** CSS is preloaded to avoid render-blocking, with `<noscript>` fallback
- **Lazy Loading Images:** Offscreen images now use `loading="lazy"`
- **Responsive Images:** `srcset` is used for modern image delivery

### 💨 Fonts Optimization

- Reduced font calls by consolidating to essential weights/styles
- Added `preconnect` to font sources to improve load time

### 🔍 SEO & Accessibility Improvements

- All images now include `alt` and `title` attributes
- HTML includes `lang="en"` and proper meta descriptions
- Meta tags are organized for social media and search previews

### 🔐 Privacy & Compliance

- All external links use `referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"`
- Included compliance disclaimers and opt-out mechanisms
- Retained tracking/analytics scripts but deferred loading

## 💡 Notes on Key Decisions

- **Performance First:** Scripts were deferred or async-loaded to prioritize content rendering
- **Image Handling:** Optimized WebP images improve load times significantly
- **Critical Assets First:** CSS and fonts were loaded early, non-blocking
- **Analytics Maintained:** Mixpanel, Google Analytics, and other trackers are still present but better organized

## 🚀 Result

The optimized landing page now:

- Loads faster, especially on mobile
- Is easier to maintain
- Preserves all marketing and tracking capabilities
- Offers a better user experience with cleaner, structured HTML
